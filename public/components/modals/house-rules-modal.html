            <h3>Additional Rules</h3>
            <p><strong>Hot Tub (Spa) Heating:</strong> Please let me know ahead of your arrival if you would like the hot tub heated and we can coordinate for it to be ready for your enjoyment. It takes about an hour for the spa to get to full temperature and it is $60 for each 3 hour interval.</p>

            <p><strong>Pool Heating:</strong> If you would like the pool heated upon arrival there is a $250 per day fee. If you would like the pool heated just let me know in advance as it takes about a day to get to full temperature.</p>

            <p><strong>Early Check in / Late Check out:</strong> If possible, I can arrange for an early check in or late check out for a $50 fee for each, and only if the guest calendar and cleaning schedule allows. It will be based on a case by case basis. Feel free just to ask.</p>

            <h3>More About the Property</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>There is a road behind the property. You may hear occasional cars as they drive by.</li>
                <li>I just bought this property recently, my plan is to finish the yard in stages. Any requests for games, zones, activities you would like to enjoy in the future let me know, as I am currently making my plans. But your patience as I finish this huge yard is so deeply appreciated as it is a very timely undertaking. Currently the back yard is leveled and graded dirt. I just added a beautiful fire pit and there is corn hole by the pool. Dream with me as you imagine the paradise we are building together.</li>
                <li>Please lock the front door with only the smart lock by pressing the Yale logo, and make sure you lock all windows when not on the premises and at night. Please DO NOT lock the bottom door handle lock on the front door when you leave. 🙌</li>
                <li>Thank you for staying at Desert Serenity and I truly hope you have the absolute best time here 🥳</li>
